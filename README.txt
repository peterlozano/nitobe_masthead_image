This is a simple utility to set the image displayed in the 'masthead' region of the great Nitobe theme by Shannon Lucas.

With Nitobe theme settings you can choose between displaying a random image on each page view or a fixed image for all the site. This module allows you to choose a per-path image to be displayed.

You can configure the module at admin/build/nitobemasthead.
